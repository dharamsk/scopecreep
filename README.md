Welcome to Scope Creep!

This is a silly turn-based game where you try to stay alive and kill all enemies.
You don't have any weapons and the enemies will kill you on contact, but you leave 
behind a trail of Oxygen (+) when you move which hurts enemies when they come into 
contact with it. They'll avoid it if possible, so get crafty!

To learn more, run the game in your terminal:

`python3 scope_creep.py`
